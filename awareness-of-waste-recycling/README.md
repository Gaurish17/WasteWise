![GIF](static/images/awareness_of_waste_recycling.png)

#### The world generates at least 3.5 million tons of waste per day and this number is still increasing day by day that's why we need to aware about waste.
#### This web application can classify waste with 9 different waste materials and it will show you the details of that particular waste materials. This will help to raise awareness for people to reduce and recycle waste.

## Overview
- There are **LIGHT BLUBS, PAPER, PLASTIC, ORGANIC, GLASS, BATTERIES, CLOTHES, METAL, E-WASTE** total 9 different types of waste materials which are use for recycling.
- In this project i have collected and filtered data by my self from google images and dreamstime.com
- Here i have **8369 images** belonging **9 classes**.
- Here i have trained dataset using **VGG16** Transfer Learning technique of CNN for classification.
- Here i have trained this model till **28 epochs** and i got **69.77%** accuracy.
- Initially i had trained my model with **Inceptionv3** and it's gave me **90.34%** accuracy. But it was not accurate when i tested it on some images. But when i tested **VGG16** with **69.77%** accuracy it gives me accurate result.

## Data Source
- In this project i have collected and filtered data by my self from google images and dreamstime.com
- I have uploaded my dataset on google drive.

## Demo
- I have deployed this on AWS Elastic Beanstalk platform
Link: [http://wasterecycling-env.eba-xcpktyd2.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/](http://wasterecycling-env.eba-xcpktyd2.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/)

## How to use
- Click on image icon and upload image or if you are on mobile then click on camera icon and capture the waste and upload image.
- Click on Classify your waste material button it will classify your waste and show you the result in details

## Deployment
#### Prepare a configuration file in main directory
1. Create .ebextensions folder to your main directory
2. Inside .ebextensions folder create a python.config file and write configration like [this](https://github.com/jaysoftic/awareness-of-waste-recycling/blob/master/.ebextensions/python.config)
3. Create .ebignore file inside main directory

#### Here's simple steps to create an application on Elastic Bean Stalk
1. Open the Elastic Beanstalk console using this link: https://console.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/home#/gettingStarted?applicationName=getting-started-app
2. Enter your application name.
3. Application tags are optional so just ignore it.
4. For Platform, choose a python platform.
5. For Application code choose Upload your code.
6. Upload a zip file of your project.
7. Click on create application button.

- rest of the things will take care by aws elastic bean stalk and you will get deployed link.
